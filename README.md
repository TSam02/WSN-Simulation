# WSN-Simulation
Simulation of distributed Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) of interconnected EV charging nodes.

## Background of the simulation
In this simulation, multiple charging nodes with multiple charging ports are governed by a central base station. 

The base station coordinates the selection of EV charging stations based on the availability of charging ports in the current nodes as well as neighbouring nodes, considering positions such as up, down, left, and right if they exist. 

The simulation involves randomizing the availability of ports in each charging node at regular intervals, conducting checks, and logging the resulting data for analysis.
